Experimentation made during the taiwan eTextile summercamp in the Atayal tribe. 

When the headhunters was come back from their hunt, on the top of the mountain they were screaming 
to annonce their back and their woman can prepare the loom to weave the hunter jacket.

Using the mountain pattern present on the hunter jacket, we made a sound reactive fabric to remind the calling of the hunter.
